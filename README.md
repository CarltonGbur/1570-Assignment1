#1570 Assignment1 
I made a small five-page site called Streetwear Favorites because I wanted a simple, clean place to show a few brands I like while practicing and meeting the requirements of the assignment.
The home page gives a quick overview and a tiny “compare at a glance” table you can filter by price tier.
The four brand pages, Cole Henry, Creations by Dav, Scuffers, and Burberry, feature a centered image with a short description about the brand and how I found them or what I know about them. I used semantic tags 
<header>, <nav>, <main>, and and <footer>, plus normal headings/paragraphs and <figure>/<img> to bundle visuals. The home table uses proper structure (<caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, th, td) so it’s readable and screen-reader friendly.
Visually, everything is unified by a navy header with white lettering, a centered content column, responsive centered images, pill-style nav links with hover/active/visited states, comfy system-UI typography, and zebra-striped tables. 
I made the header sticky so navigation stays put. JavaScript adds a one-click theme toggle (it flips a dark class on <body>), click-to-zoom images, a working price-tier filter for the table, auto-highlighting of the current nav link, and a live year in the footer.
